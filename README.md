# CIFAR-10 CNN Classification

Welcome to the CIFAR-10 CNN Classification project repository! This project showcases a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for the classification of images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The model has achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 77% when evaluated against the test dataset.

## About CIFAR-10

CIFAR-10 is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and deep learning. It consists of 50,000 color images, each with a resolution of 32x32 pixels, 
categorized into ten distinct classes. These classes include common objects such as 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', and 'truck'.

## Model Overview

The CNN model architecture implemented in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for down-sampling, and fully connected layers for classification. 
While the current model demonstrates solid performance, it can be further customized and optimized to achieve even higher accuracy rates.
